# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Update check would silently fail with "Couldn't reach GitHub" even when
  the network was fine. The GitHub client now uses an explicit
  `SocketsHttpHandler`, exposes the actual error message, retries once on
  transient network failures, and shows a visible "Retry" button in the
  About tab.

### Added

#### Deep cleanup (safe by design)
- New **Deep cleanup** tab with opt-in categories and a scan-first workflow.
- **System categories**: NVIDIA / AMD / Intel installer leftovers, Windows
  Update cache, Delivery Optimization cache, Windows Installer patch cache
  (`$PatchCache$`), TEMP folders, Prefetch, crash dumps and WER reports,
  old CBS logs (> 30 days), DirectX shader cache, Recycle Bin on every
  fixed drive.
- **Gaming launcher caches** (never game files, never logins):
  - Steam browser & depot cache (`appcache`, `htmlcache`, `depotcache`, `logs`)
  - Steam per-game shader cache (`steamapps\shadercache`)
  - Epic Games Launcher webcache and logs
  - Battle.net agent cache and Blizzard launcher cache
  - Riot Client / League of Legends client logs
  - GOG Galaxy webcache and redists
  - EA Desktop / Origin cache and logs
- **Windows.old** is detected and shown with an "Irreversible" tag — never
  selected by default.
- Every deletion is wrapped in try/catch so locked files are skipped, not
  forced. A live total shows how much space you'll reclaim.

#### Large files finder
- Scan any preset folder (Downloads, Documents, Desktop, Videos, Pictures,
  Music, Program Files, Program Files x86) or a whole fixed drive.
- Configurable min size (default 500 MB) and top N results (default 100).
- Read-only: results only expose "Show in Explorer" and "Copy path" —
  deletion is disabled by design, even with admin rights.
- Skips pagefile/hiberfil/swapfile, WinSxS, System Volume Information,
  Recycle Bin and critical system config folders.

#### Update system
- Auto update check on startup against the GitHub Releases API, plus a
  manual "Check for updates" button.
- New **About** tab showing the current version, build date, license, and
  a full release-note history pulled live from GitHub.
- Discreet banner in the main window when a newer version is detected,
  linking to the About tab for details.
- Automatic background download of the new build with a progress bar.
  If the automatic download is blocked, a "Manual download" button opens
  the GitHub release page in the browser.
- One-click "Install" button that launches the downloaded build and
  closes the current instance so the new version takes over.

### Safety
- Deep cleanup **never** touches: browser caches / cookies / passwords,
  launcher login tokens, the registry, active drivers, Program Files,
  `AppData\Roaming` (live app settings), `ProgramData\NVIDIA` root, or
  actual game files in `steamapps\common`.
- Large files finder is read-only — no delete button exists, so a
  mis-click can't hurt anything important.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- File-system scan auto-discovers all fixed NTFS/ReFS drives and shows a
  checkbox list. Scan one drive, a few, or all of them — runs sequentially
  so disks don't fight for I/O.
- "Scan selected" button in System Health for bulk chkdsk.
- Auto-check for the PSWindowsUpdate module on the Windows Update tab. A
  yellow card prompts installation if it's missing.
- Background-task indicators for SFC and DISM so you can navigate away while
  they grind in the background.

### Fixed
- chkdsk "Access is denied" when the app was launched from a non-system
  working directory (e.g. `E:\Downloads`). All spawned processes now start
  from `System32`.

### Changed
- SFC and DISM no longer block the whole Cleanup tab. Each has its own
  running state; you can keep cleaning TEMP or browsing other tabs while
  they run.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Self-contained single-file publish profile (`publish.ps1`).
- README, ARCHITECTURE, TESTING, and LICENSE documentation.
- `.gitignore` tuned for .NET / WPF projects.

### Changed
- README rewritten as a general-purpose local monitoring tool.
